<p>
We’re back!  If you haven’t noticed the increase in cyclocross-related emails, it’s officially the beginning of cyclocross season in Chicago.  The first stop of the Chicago Cyclocross Cup Series was held on Sunday at Caldwell Woods on the corner if Devon and Milwaukee on Chicago’s north side.  Caldwell replaces Jackson Park this year after we were squeezed onto a smaller portion of the park a few years ago.  This new venue is much larger and better supports the 100 rider fields of than Jackson Park.  
</br>
</br>
Caldwell Woods certainly did not disappoint.  The folks at XXX Racing did a great job constructing a well-balanced course with plenty of straightaways, flowy twists, and short steep hills.  Hopefully everyone behaved themselves and the Forest Preserve District will welcome us back again next year.  
</br>
</br>
Speaking of new, Shane McQuillan, Catlin Urban, Natalie Mouw, and Steve Prinner (I’m not counting relay cross, Steve) all took on cyclocross for the first time (based on crossresults.com)!  Thanks for coming out, I trust you have all been properly bitten by the 'cross bug and will be out again next week!
</p>

<p>And finally, the results from Sunday - ABD had a great turnout.  According to my count, we had 18 racers out there on Sunday.  (This is probably a good time to say, sorry if I missed anyone in this write-up.  Please let me know and I’ll give you the proper “shout-out.”)  We had some great results and lots of riders improving on last year:
</br>
Tony Pacini brought home 2nd in the 55+ race, followed by a team time trial of Walter Stoops, Ludwig Monfort, and Daniel Madsen in 17th, 18th, and 19th, respectively.  Ross Browne came in 24th.
</br>
</br>
In the Men’s 1/2/3 race Brad Dash finished 32nd.
</br>
</br>
In the Cat 3 race, Ben Demong finished 9th, Bryan McVey came back from his last-place staging position to finish 38th, I was 45th, and Jim Canella finished 74th.
</br>
</br>
In the 45+ race, Jim Nowak came in 27th and Steve Prinner was 54th.
</br>
</br>
Always looking to suffer some more, Jim Nowak tried out the Single Speed category and finished 28th.
</br>
</br>
In the 35+ race, Brian Urban finished 70th.
</br>
</br>
Brianna Urban, our sole Junior racer on Sunday, finished the 9-14 race in 24th place.
</br>
</br>
In the Women’s Cat 4 race Catlin Urban came in 43rd, followed by Natalie Mouw at 44th.
</br>
</br>
Shane McQuillan finished 30th in the cat 4 race, followed by Jerry Meister in 70th.
</br>
</br>
Jerry immediately followed the cat 4 race by racing in the cat 4/5 race, finishing 40th.
</br>
</br>
I think that’s everyone, if not let me know.  I hope to see you all out in DeKalb to enjoy the fun course and the wonderful hospitality of the Witt’s.
