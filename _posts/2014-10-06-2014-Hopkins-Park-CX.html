What a difference seven days makes!  Last week at Caldwell woods it was 80 degrees and sunny, this Sunday at Hopkins park in Dekalb temps were in the 40s!  Not only was it chilly, but rain Friday and Saturday left the course tacky throughout and muddy in a few low-lying spots.  The course featured wide fast turns, no real difficult technical sections, and, of course, a flyover.  The lung busting course was fast and left little room for recovery.

</br>
You will note in the results below that we had a number of our first-timers back for more.  Little do they know that cyclocross is habit forming.
</br>
</br>
Speaking of addictive, the baked goods brought by Sue Witt were amazing.  Really.  Amazing.  Sue and Scott were out in force with the Crosspitality tent, stocked with brats, beverages, Gu, and did I mention Sue’s baked goods?  A huge thanks to Sue and Scott for their support!

Before I get to the results, a quick
word on Dan Ryan Woods next week.  As Jim Nowak mentioned in his email yesterday, a good thing to practice this week is bunny hops.  DRW has featured small barriers (~4”) that are hopable by most riders.  However, this takes practice.  In fact, I hear that nasty crashes have ended seasons.  If you can’t jump the height of a 2x4 ten out of ten times, you might think about running these.  As with anything in ‘cross everything is more difficult in the race - other riders, screaming “fans,” fatigue, etc.  You will be booed for running, but at least you’re still in the fight.  Try them during preride and make a decision before your race starts.
