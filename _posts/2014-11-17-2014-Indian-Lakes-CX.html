<p>
Lots of racing this weekend at Indian Lakes Resort in Bloomingdale for stops eight and nine of the Chicago Cyclocross Cup.  A big thank you to the Witt’s, who were out in force with food and beverages to keep everyone fueled and warm.
</br>
 Saturday was cold and windy, while Sunday was cold with a healthy amount of snowfall.  Judging by the results from Sunday, ABD racers really enjoyed that bit of moisture on Sunday!

Congrats to everyone on a great weekend.  Next week is the Melas Basin Race, a race in a large drainage basin - lots of climbing and off camber!  Even more fun, the forecast (at this point) calls for some rain/snow!
