Stop # 3 of the Chicago Cross Cup brought us to Dan Ryan Woods on Chicagoâ€™s south side. DRW is well known for a large hill that has both wooded areas with rooted, technical single track and open spaces for sledding in the winter. Race promoters Beverly Bike-Vee Pak took full advantage of the terrain this year to create a tough, challenging course. Course conditions changed drastically throughout the day with early racers facing treacherous muddy descents, slick off-camber sections, and tacky dirt turns. However, by mid-day, the bright sun and brisk breeze dried the slippery sections somewhat and made many of the turns loose and dusty.
</p>

<p><strong>ABD had some great results on the tough course:</strong>
</br>
Tony Pacini took 1st in the Masters 55+ race and is in 2nd place in the series behind Greg Anderson of Spindoctors. Congrats Tony!
</br>
</br>
Brad Dash was 31st in the men's 123 race
</br>
</br>
Ben Demong finished a series best 7th place in the Cat 3 race; he is now 7th in the series. I was 44th, Jim Cannella finished 68th, and Tony Pacini had to DNF when his leg went numb after he banged a pedal off the back of his knee.
</br>
</br>
Shane "I have no idea what you just said" McQuillan finished 26th in the 35+ race, while Brain Urban finished 50th.
</br>
</br>
In the 45+ race, Jim Nowak was 20th, and Steve Prinner finished 57th.

Brian Urban and Jerry Meister raced the cat 4s and finished 70th and 93, respectively.
</br>
</br>
In the cat 4/5 race Jerry Meister doubled up and finished 61 followed by Kurtis Donald at 78th.
</br>
</br>
I think I got everyone, yell at me if I didn't.
</br>
</br>
Next up is Carpentersville, which is great race for spectating. There is an Octoberfest alongside the race, complete with a bouncy house for the kids and a beer garden for the rest of us. And don't forget: Carpentersville is one the the races that will feature the hospitality of Scott and Sue Witt. The weather forecast looks perfect, see you out there!
