<p>
  We are a month away from the Winfield Criterium and it is already looking to
  be an exciting event. We have shortened this year from a 2-day event to a
  single, twilight event through the popular Winfield subdivision. The course is
  exactly the same as years past, with the addition of the extended course to
  make your legs work even harder as you grind up the hill, in between the
  neighborhood parties.

  More information about this race can be located on the <a
    href="http://www.winfieldcriterium.com/">Winfield Criterium</a> website.
  While there, look at the schedule and make sure you pre-register to save
  yourself some time and a few bucks.
