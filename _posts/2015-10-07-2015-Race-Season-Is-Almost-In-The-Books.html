First off, a huge thank you to everyone that came out to our Fall Fling, racers
and volunteers!
</p>

<p>
Congratulations to all of the winners, including the 2015 Fall Fling Team
Winner, Tower Racing, claiming the $1,000 prize. WDT and ABD tried to put up a
fight, but Tower was just to much to handle this fall. Imagine if teams like
EGO, PLUS, Bicycle Heaven, and more were able to field 5 riders every event, it
would have been a much closer fight to the finish for sure.

<p>
ABD would also like to thank Lisa Pena, Scott Witt, Bob Lundberg, and Rich
Johnson for hosting the summer's Practice Crits. If you have not joined us, plan
on attending next years races, every Wednesday night!
</p>

<p>
Thank you once again to all of the racers and the volunteers!
