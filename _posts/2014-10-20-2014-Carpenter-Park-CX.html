Chicago Cross Cup stop #4 was at Carpenter Park in Carpentersville yesterday.  This race is paired with an annual Octoberfest and makes for a great fall atmosphere.  Of course, we had own atmosphere by the ABD compound.  Sue and Scott Witt were out in force with refreshments, some delicious baked goods, and some plenty of food off the grill (I think I saw some potato pancakes).  Thanks, as always, for coming out!

Next, week is the ABD sponsored race at Sunrise Park in Bartlett!  We are still looking for some volunteers, check out Jim’ Nowak’s previous emails for the details and how to set up.  Hope to see you out there!

The course was roughly the same as past years - only backwards!  The starting chute led to two couple of long sweeping turns, leaving plenty of time to spread out the field before a long series of turns.  This section wasn’t too difficult, but if you didn’t exit one turn and properly set up for the next, you would expend valuable energy trying to keep up with your competitors.  All the turns then brought racers to the infamous dirt rollers in the cornfield.  Really intended as a BMX-style pump track, this year the rollers were spaced further apart making the timing less tricky than past years.  Coming out of the rollers was a peanut buttery mud section - keep to the well-worn track or get bogged down in the
thick mud.  Next came a single barrier and a creek crossing, a few turns and you were up the little hill and an off camber turn.  Over a set of three barrier, around a fun banked turn, and a long sweeping turn to the finish.

<p><strong>Results:</strong>
</br>
Tony Pacini took second in the 55+, but beat his chief rival, Greg Heck, who finished 3rd.  Tony remains in 2nd place overall in the series, just 10 points out of the lead.  Tony was followed by Luddy Monfort at 10th, Craig McKenzie in 15th, Walter Stoops in 17th, and Ross Browne in 29th.  Ross assures us that, while he may not be up front with Tony, he is learning!

And, finally, to wrap it up with some controversy, Catlin Urban passed a competitor from BFF Racing before the finish line, but she wasn’t given credit for
her effort by the judge and she was still scored last of 47 Cat 4 Women.  That’s okay, Catlin, we all know you won, and that’s all that counts!

I hope I got everyone.  Thanks for reading.
