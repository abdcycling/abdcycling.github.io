<p>
The folks at Garner Cyclery and Flatladia brought us to Melas Park in Mount Prospect to race in a massive drainage basin (aka the racin' basin).  Temps in the 50s and plenty of rain Saturday and a constant drizzle on Sunday made for some muddy, slick conditions - perfect 'cross weather!  The course was exhausting.  Lots of muddy off camber.  Three trips through sand.  Steep climbs.  If you could catch your breath on some of the long descents, you were promptly treated to a leg-draining power section.  A few off camber sections were littered with tree roots giving riders plenty of "ride or run" decisions.  All in all, a fun and very challenging course.  Don't forget your bike maintenance!  Sand and mud tends to get everywhere.  Your headset (especially if you went down in the sand), bottom bracket, and entire drive train are most likely in need of a little TLC.  Just a little maintenance will help avoid real costly repairs and, even worse, a DNF!
