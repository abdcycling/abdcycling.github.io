Stop 6 of the Chicago Cyclocross Cup was at the Halloween-themed Campton Hills Park, brought to us by our friends at Bicycle Heaven.  The course had a few changes from past years and it looked like they added a few more power sections, but brought back the off-camber turns and the beloved single track sections that offered opportunities to “get rad,” as the kids say. However, I wasn’t there, so I could be wrong on all of this.

<p><strong>ABD had a number of great results this weekend:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tricia Fleischer was in town this weekend and finished second in the Women’s 1/2/3, congrats!</li>
	<li>Tony Pacini again won the men’s 55+ race.</li>
	<li>Ben Demong took a step toward his season goals and earned some upgrade points.  He was just off the Cat 3 podium in fourth place </strong>, which, without doing any actual research, I’m assuming is Ben’s best finish in the Chicago Cross Cup Cat 3s.</li>
	<li>In the Men’s 1/2/3, Brad Dash finished 41st and Tricia Fleischer finished 44th.</li>
	<li>In the Cat 3 race Bryan McVey finished 29th and Jim Cannella was 50th.</strong></li>
	<li>In the 55+ race, Luddy Montfort finished 14th, Craig McKenzie was 18th, Walter Stoops was 20th and Ross Browne finished 22nd.</li>
	<li>In the Men’s 45+, Jim Nowak finished 11th and Steve Prinner finished 56th</li>
	<li>In the Men’s 35+, Brian Urban finished 42nd.</li>
	<li>Brianna Urban was 18th and Julie Esposito was 36th in the Junior 9-14 category</li>
	<li>In the Women’s Cat 4, Wendy Esposito finished 14th , Natalie Mouw finished 34th, and Catlin Urban finished 41st.</li>
	<li>Jerry Meister finished 58th in the Men’s Cat 4.</li>
</ul>
