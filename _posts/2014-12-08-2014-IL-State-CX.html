Last stop of the Chicago Cross Cup series was on Chicago's lakefront at Montrose beach.  The course changes from year-to-year sometimes incorporating various parts of the beach and the surrounding terrain, but you can be guaranteed lots of sand and at least one trip up Cricket Hill.  This year many of the technical features of year's past were taken out in favor of long power sections and taping wide enough to give an advantage to riders skilled at carrying their speed through turns.  Add to these long power sections a few trips through the loose, power-sapping sand and it made for a tough course.  Temps were chilly, but not too bad and the sky, but the wind was howling.

As some may know, USAC changed the rules this year to qualify for the Elite National Championship race.  Whereas last year any Cat 2 rider could contest the Elite race, this year the Elite race is only open to riders with UCI points, which are not easy to come by.  You have to be at the front of a UCI race.  Turns out Tricia Fleischer is fast.  She finished 10th twice this past weekend, scoring her some coveted UCI points!  Congrats Tricia, we look forward to watching for you in the live feed!

Finally, before I wrap this up, I want to give a quick thank you to everyone who made this year of ABD CX not only a success, but a ton of fun.  This has been a bit of a challenging year for me, but the camaraderie has kept me motivated to keep coming out.  Thanks to everyone involved this year from Jim, Ben, Brad, Jim to all the new faces I have gotten to know this fall.  It has really been fun.  Not to mention that the setup was amazing - everything from a tent to keep the sun off our heads to astroturf to keep the mud off our feet.  And of course, the support of Mary Lee, Mike Farrell, and Prairie Path Cycles is greatly appreciated.  I am so excited at the growth we have seen over just the past few years as more ABDers get the CX bug.  Looking forward to next year.  See you all on the road (maybe, we'll see).
