<p>
First off, a huge thank you to Jim Nowak for all his efforts to make Stop # 5 of the Chicago Cross Cup happen for ABD every year.  Not to mention the foresight to plan the race on such beautiful fall day - brilliant!  While a little chilly in the morning, the mid-day races were treated to very little wind (rare for Sunrise park), temps around 70 degrees, and sunny skies.  And of course, thanks to the Witts for the ‘cross-pitality tent!
</p>
<p>
The course was similar to last year complete with log-jumps, wooded sections, off-camber turns, and power sections.  Jim did a great job laying out the course to nestle the technical sections between the power to afford some recovery time.  Finding those key times to catch your breath after putting in a hard effort is a key part of any course and something to think about during your course recon before each race.

</br>
</br>
Next week is a fun Halloween-themed race put on by Bicycle Heaven.  The course at Campton Hills is a challenging one - plenty of technical single track, some railroad tie stairs, off-camber, long power sections, etc.  If that's not enough, the Witts will be out in force once again.  This is one of my favorite courses, but, unfortunately, I won't be
out there to watch the costumed crazies.  So good luck everyone, and see you in two weeks.
