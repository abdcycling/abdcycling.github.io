    What an amazing 4 months it has been. We completed 4 indoor events and
    finished the series outside in Maple Park, IL for the John Fraser Memorial
    Time Trial. Participation was about even with previous years and once again,
    for the second year in a row, new riders were showing up to the events. Now
    if we can just get more categories to have at least 3 riders complete all
    events so there are more overall awards presented.

<p>
    Speaking of awards and results, congratulations are due for the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>EMC<sup>2</sup></strong> - Team Competition Winners</li>
    <li><strong>Grzegorz Monko</strong> <small>(WDT-Allvoi)</small> - Men Category 1/2 Overall Winner</li>
    <li><strong>Jason Knauff</strong> <small>(Burnham Racing)</small> - Men Category 3 Overall Winner</li>
    <li><strong>Dan Verner</strong> <small>(PACT)</small> - Master&rsquo;s Men 45-49 Overall Winner</li>
    <li><strong>Job Bobka</strong> <small>(Bicycle Heaven)</small> - Master&rsquo;s Men 55-59 Overall Winner</li>
    <li><strong>Daniel Madsen</strong> <small>(ABD Cycling)</small> - Master&rsquo;s Men 60-64 Overall Winner</li>
    <li>The 3 fastest Men and Women at each event</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Unlike last year, ABD Cycling was unable to surpass the strength and
    successfulness that EMC<sup>2</sup> was able to lay down. They stayed strong
    from the gate, and never once looked back. Congratulations on an award well
    deserved!
</p>

    Now that the weather is getting nicer, it is time to head outdoors and start
    the road cycling season in style. ABD Cycling is scheduled to next host the
    Master&rsquo;s Memorial Day Weekend in Wood Dale, IL followed by the
    Winfield Twilight Criterium, Fall Fling, and the Sunrise Park Cyclocross
    race. We are excited that the season kicked off smoothly and we are thankful
    that you all participated. We look forward to mixing it up in the pack now
    for the rest of the year. Good luck everyone, and thank you for helping to
    make the 2014 Indoor Time Trial Series such a success!
