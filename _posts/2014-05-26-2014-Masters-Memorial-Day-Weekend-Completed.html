    Could you ask for more perfect weather? Every single day was absolutely
    gorgeous, and with the exception for what seems to be 2 minor crashes a very
    safe weekend. Thank you everyone who came out and participated, whether you
    were a volunteer, a spectator, or a racer, your appearance was highly
    appreciated.
