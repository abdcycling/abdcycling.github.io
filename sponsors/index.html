          Trek, a Midwest-based company, is another supporter of Athletes By Design since the beginning.
          Trek is one of the biggest bicycle manufacturers in the world, and has been since 1979. Their
          mission back then was simple: Build the best bikes in the world. Today, they've added to
          that mission: Help the world use the bicycle as a simple solution to complex problems. They
          believe in bikes! Check out their entire line of bicycles at Prairie Path Cycles.

          Bontrager has been supporting Athletes By Design for many years. Bontrager&rsquo;s
          existence is ultimately linked to the exploration and enjoyment of playground
          earth while riding on two wheels. Bontrager makes bicycle components, assessories
          and apparel, all firmly grounded in no-nonsense design philosophy, valuing
          performance and usability, not fads and gimmicks. Check out Bontrager&rsquo;s
          entire line of components, accessories, and apparel at Prairie Path Cycles.
