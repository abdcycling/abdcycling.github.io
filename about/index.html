<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
  The Athletes By Design (ABD) Cycling Club has grown to be one of the largest
  clubs in the Midwest. Originally focusing on the development of young
  talented junior riders, ABD has now grown to include riders of all ages at
  all abilities and promotes the growth of the sport of cycling through
  numerous events they organize.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
  Mike Farrell and Al Gandolfi co-founded the Athletes By Design coaching
  firm in 1992 to help athletes reach their full potential. Through the
  structure and guidance of working with USCF certified coaches and former
  national-caliber athletes, Athletes By Design featured up-and-coming talent
  from around the Midwest, primarily elite-level junior riders.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
  Since then, the Athletes By Design Cycling Club has developed into a nationally
  recognized club that supports a competitive NRC Men's Elite Cycling Team,
  creates a productive environment for the development of young (junior) riders,
  boasts a large contingent of master's level cyclists and provides an
  environment for all cyclists (both recreational and competitive) to enjoy
  their sport and be better riders.
</p>

<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
<p class="text-justify">
  ABD focuses on developing riders, not always focusing on results. Some of the
  highlights of the team include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A weekly club-ride on Monday nights from Prairie Path Cycles in Winfield, IL.
    The ride moves at an easy pace so as to allow the group to work on handling
    and fluidity</li>
  <li>"Off-the-bike" functions throughout the year to help everyone put faces with the names</li>
  <li>A club email group to keep members updated on upcoming races, training rides, club functions and race results</li>
  <li>A mentor program where the club tries to partner junior riders with a more experienced rider</li>
  <li>Discounts and support with equipment, clothing, and race entry fees</li>
  <li>The club assists in putting on 14 sanctioned races a year, including the annual Winfield
    Criterium Weekend, the MATTS Indoor Time Trial Series each spring and the season
    wrap-up "Fall Fling"</li>
  <li>All of ABD's events are geared to be as "rookie-friendly" as possible but also provide
    a level of organization and support the veteran riders deserve</li>
  <li>ABD is proud to have strong backing from various individuals and organizations,
    including strong support from <a href="http://prairiepathcycles.com/">Prairie Path Cycles</a></li>
</ul>
