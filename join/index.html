          Athletes By Design is dedicated to promoting the sport of cycling
          and helping riders of all ages and abilities to become better riders.
          ABD currently has over 100 members ranging from 6 to 80 years young
          and from cycling “newbies” to current and former Olympians as well
          as Professional Riders. We are pleased to help de-mystify the world
          of racing for newcomers. ABD members are located throughout the
          Midwest with the heart of the organization in Chicago’s Western Suburbs.
          ABD’s “home base” is at Prairie Path Cycles in Winfield, IL.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          A great place to get started and meet a few of our members is on the
          regularly scheduled Monday Night Recovery Ride from April to September
          (weather permitting – please check out <a href="/news/">News</a> and
          <a href="http://www.twitter.com/abdcycling">Twitter</a> feed for updates.
          The ride is open to the public and averages 17mph and is a quick 90
          minute ride through Winfield, West Chicago, and Wayne. With so many
          members, chances are you’ll see other ABD’ers on pretty much any regular
          weekly ride in the Western Suburbs!
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Applying for membership in ABD is as easy as sending in the annual
          <a href="/public/pdf/ABD_App.pdf">membership form</a> (or better yet, dropping it off at Prairie Path Cycles
          in Winfield, IL) along with your membership fee. ABD has a general
          open-enrollment policy, with the main exception being Category 1/2 men.
          (1/2 riders, please submit a full resume to Mike Farrell). Beyond that,
          it’s up to you to take advantage of all the benefits ABD has to offer!
